I tinker with computers and hardware for fun, learning, and profit. In my spare time, I focus on:
- ‚ö° Cloud & Kubernetes engineering  
- üõ†Ô∏è Custom hardware projects, especially Split keyboards like Sweep and Corne
- üïµÔ∏è Security research: pentesting, CPTS, HTB writeups  
- üñ•Ô∏è Homelab experiments with servers, networking, and AI setups  

I'm currently working on:
- **Custom keyboards:** Designing, building, and configuring split keyboards like Sweep and Corne
- **Pentesting & CTFs:** Writeups of Hack The Box challenges, security research, and CPTS studies
- **Go & Rust:** Building tools and infrastructure projects in Go, exploring new libraries and frameworks
- **Kubernetes & Homelab:** Orchestrating services, local LLMs, and cloud experiments in a personal homelab

If you enjoy tinkering with Security, hardware, or AI cloud infra, feel free to reach out or explore my writeups and projects.
