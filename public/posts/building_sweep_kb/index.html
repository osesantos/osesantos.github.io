<meta name="description" content="My Adventure Building a Sweep Keyboard
Here starts my journey as a blogger and technology enthusiast.
My love for keyboards started when I decided that I wanted a small keyboard that it could make me more productive and that I could take with me everywhere. Until then I only used the laptop keyboards and the big membrane keyboards, and it was ok for all my life however when you are a software developer sometimes a regular keyboard is not enough. You want to stand out, you want to be different, you want to be that guy that you look and thinks &ldquo;wow if that guy uses that keyboard to write code then he should be the best :p&rdquo;.
So I&rsquo;ve stater to look for the best alternative and, I want it all, I wanted lights, I wanted mechanical switches layers upon layers, compact design but also retro look, like those old white, gray and beige keyboards that you could find in the 90s.
After some deep research I found what I thought would be a keyboard for the rest of my life, and damn I was wrong&hellip; I found the Vortex core 40% keyboard, it was perfect, it had everything I wanted, it was compact, it had lights, it had mechanical switches and it was retro looking. I ordered it and waited for it to arrive.
Upon arrival I quickly realized that it would take me some time to really get the grasp of it, but it was ok. I was ready to learn, I was ready to adapt.">

<p>Here starts my journey as a blogger and technology enthusiast.</p>
<p>My love for keyboards started when I decided that I wanted a small keyboard that it could make me more productive and that I could take with me everywhere. Until then I only used the laptop keyboards and the big membrane keyboards, and it was ok for all my life however when you are a software developer sometimes a regular keyboard is not enough. You want to stand out, you want to be different, you want to be that guy that you look and thinks &ldquo;wow if that guy uses that keyboard to write code then he should be the best :p&rdquo;.
So I&rsquo;ve stater to look for the best alternative and, I want it all, I wanted lights, I wanted mechanical switches layers upon layers, compact design but also retro look, like those old white, gray and beige keyboards that you could find in the 90s.
After some deep research I found what I thought would be a keyboard for the rest of my life, and damn I was wrong&hellip; I found the Vortex core 40% keyboard, it was perfect, it had everything I wanted, it was compact, it had lights, it had mechanical switches and it was retro looking. I ordered it and waited for it to arrive.
Upon arrival I quickly realized that it would take me some time to really get the grasp of it, but it was ok. I was ready to learn, I was ready to adapt.</p>
<p><em>TODO: Add image of the Vortex Core Keyboard</em>
<img alt="Vortex Core Keyboard" loading="lazy" src="/vortexcore.jpg"></p>
<p>Fast forward some months I started to look at alternatives just for the fun of it, and then it was my fall, I got in the rabbit hole of custom keyboards. I started looking at all different shapes and sizes, and different layouts, switches, keys, firmware, hacks, etc, etc&hellip; It is a world so big that the more you look into it the more you risk uncovering keyboards so exotic that only a few people in the world would ever try them, and the ones that don&rsquo;t would look at you with thinking you are crazy.
But I didn&rsquo;t care, I was hooked, I wanted to try some new keyboards.</p>
<p>My next keyboard was the kyria with choc white switches, It was split keyboard, It was ergonomic, it had great documentation, it was open source, all that a newbie like me could want.
The day it arrived I was so excited, that what was meant to be just a &ldquo;let me look at it&rdquo; turned into &ldquo;a full night of soldering and building&rdquo;. I was so excited that I didn&rsquo;t even care about the fact that I had to solder all the switches, I was ready to do it, I was ready to learn.
In the end I managed to build it, and it was great, I loved every moment of it, I loved the sound, I loved the feel, I loved the look, I loved everything about it.
And, I wanted to the geeky wierd train more, so, decided to take the on the fact that I now had white keycaps without any legends on them, to learn a new layout, the Colemak-DH layout, and I did it, I learned it, and now I can&rsquo;t go back to QWERTY. My brain is locked up to how fast it is to type in Colemak-DH.</p>
<p><em>TODO: Add image of the Kyria Keyboard</em></p>
<p>But I wanted more, I really like the old vortex core brown switches, and I wanted to try them but this time on a split keyboard, so why not just build a new one. This time my choice was the corne keyboard, it was small, it was compact, it was split, everything that I was used to.
When it arrived I was so excited that I didn&rsquo;t even care about the fact that I had to solder all the switches, I was ready for another night smelling the soldering iron and listening to an old rock music.</p>
<p><em>TODO: Add image of the Corne Keyboard</em></p>
<p>But now, sometime after, I still missed the compactness of the kyria choc switches, and I wanted to take a step further into that big rabbit hole. So why not just build a smaller one?</p>
<p>In a boring night of nothing to do, I end up looking at layouts of the sweep and realized that maybe, just maybe I could be able to work with it. So I end up ordering all the parts. Now was that time I realized that it was no longer a search for being more productive but it is a hobby, a passion, a way of life.
Like the previous times, I did not care about the fact that I had to solder all the switches, I was ready for another night smelling the soldering iron while listening to some 90s.</p>
